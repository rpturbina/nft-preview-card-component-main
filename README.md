## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM CSS Methodology

### Continued development

I will continue to build this NFT component card to use it for my another project. I'm still learning how to make reusable css styling for future projects.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Style Image](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_images.asp) - This helped me for styling the image hover overlay and give border line to the avatar image. I'd recommend it to anyone for learning to style using vanilla css.
